## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 notes

With current CRAN checks, we do see failures on R-devel with Windows. This check ERROR doesn't seem to cite an actual check failure and is present on the check pages for many other packages, so we assume it is a false positive.

## Reverse dependencies

We checked 7 reverse dependencies, comparing R CMD check results across CRAN and dev versions of this package, and saw no new problems.
