# Contributing

Contributions to the `infer` whether in the form of bug fixes, issue reports, new code or documentation improvement
are encouraged and welcome. We welcome newbies who may have never contributed to a package before as well as friendly
veterans looking to help us improve the package for users.

Please use the GitHub issues. For any pull request, please link to or open a corresponding issue 
in GitHub issues. Please ensure that you have notifications turned on and respond to questions, comments or 
needed changes promptly.

##  Tests

Skimr uses `testthat` for testing. Please try to provide 100% test coverage for any submitted code and always check 
that existing tests continue to pass.  If you are a beginner and need help with writing a test, mention this
in the issue and we will try to help.

## Pull requests

Pull requests should be against the _develop_ branch not the `master` branch.  You can set this when creating 
your pull request. Please make a separately named branch to submit.  Keep each branch for a complete specific
issue.

## Code style

Please use snake case (such as `rep_sample_n`) for function names.  Besides that, in general follow the 
[tidyverse style](http://style.tidyverse.org/) style for R.

## Code of Conduct

When contributing to the `infer` package you must follow the code of 
conduct defined in [CONDUCT.md](CONDUCT.md)
