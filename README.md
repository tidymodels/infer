The objective of this package is to perform statistical inference using
an expressive statistical grammar that coheres with the `tidyverse`
design framework. The package is centered around 4 main verbs,
supplemented with many utilities to visualize and extract value from
their outputs.

- `specify()` allows you to specify the variable, or relationship
  between variables, that you’re interested in.
- `hypothesize()` allows you to declare the null hypothesis.
- `generate()` allows you to generate data reflecting the null
  hypothesis.
- `calculate()` allows you to calculate a distribution of statistics
  from the generated data to form the null distribution.

To learn more about the principles underlying the package design, see
`vignette("infer")`.

### Examples

------------------------------------------------------------------------

These examples are pulled from the “Full infer Pipeline Examples”
vignette, accessible by calling `vignette("observed_stat_examples")`.
They make use of the `gss` dataset supplied by the package, providing a
sample of data from the [General Social Survey](https://gss.norc.org).
The data looks like this:

``` r
# load in the dataset
data(gss)

# take a glimpse at it
str(gss)
```

    ## tibble [500 × 11] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)
    ##  $ year   : num [1:500] 2014 1994 1998 1996 1994 ...
    ##  $ age    : num [1:500] 36 34 24 42 31 32 48 36 30 33 ...
    ##  $ sex    : Factor w/ 2 levels "male","female": 1 2 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 ...
    ##  $ college: Factor w/ 2 levels "no degree","degree": 2 1 2 1 2 1 1 2 2 1 ...
    ##  $ partyid: Factor w/ 5 levels "dem","ind","rep",..: 2 3 2 2 3 3 1 2 3 1 ...
    ##  $ hompop : num [1:500] 3 4 1 4 2 4 2 1 5 2 ...
    ##  $ hours  : num [1:500] 50 31 40 40 40 53 32 20 40 40 ...
    ##  $ income : Ord.factor w/ 12 levels "lt $1000"<"$1000 to 2999"<..: 12 11 12 12 12 12 12 12 12 10 ...
    ##  $ class  : Factor w/ 6 levels "lower class",..: 3 2 2 2 3 3 2 3 3 2 ...
    ##  $ finrela: Factor w/ 6 levels "far below average",..: 2 2 2 4 4 3 2 4 3 1 ...
    ##  $ weight : num [1:500] 0.896 1.083 0.55 1.086 1.083 ...

As an example, we’ll run an analysis of variance on `age` and `partyid`,
testing whether the age of a respondent is independent of their
political party affiliation.

Calculating the observed statistic,

``` r
F_hat <- gss %>% 
  specify(age ~ partyid) %>%
  calculate(stat = "F")
```

Then, generating the null distribution,

``` r
null_dist <- gss %>%
   specify(age ~ partyid) %>%
   hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
   generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>%
   calculate(stat = "F")
```

Visualizing the observed statistic alongside the null distribution,

``` r
visualize(null_dist) +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = F_hat, direction = "greater")
```

<div class="figure">

The x axis ranges from zero to five. The region of the histogram to the right of the observed statistic, just above two, is shaded red to represent the p-value."  />
<p class="caption">
</p>

</div>

Calculating the p-value from the null distribution and observed
statistic,

``` r
null_dist %>%
  get_p_value(obs_stat = F_hat, direction = "greater")
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 1
    ##   p_value
    ##     <dbl>
    ## 1    0.06

Note that the formula and non-formula interfaces (i.e. `age ~ partyid`
vs. `response = age, explanatory =  partyid`) work for all implemented
inference procedures in `infer`. Use whatever is more natural for you.
If you will be doing modeling using functions like `lm()` and `glm()`,
though, we recommend you begin to use the formula `y ~ x` notation as
soon as possible.

Other resources are available in the package vignettes! See
`vignette("observed_stat_examples")` for more examples like the one
above, and `vignette("infer")` for discussion of the underlying
principles of the package design.
