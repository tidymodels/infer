# infer v1.0.4

* Fixed bug in p-value shading where shaded regions no longer correctly overlaid
  histogram bars.
* Addressed deprecation warning ahead of upcoming dplyr release.

# infer v1.0.3

* Fix R-devel HTML5 NOTEs.

# infer v1.0.2

* Fix p-value shading when the calculated statistic falls exactly on the boundaries of a histogram bin (#424).
* Fix `generate()` errors when columns are named `x` (#431).
* Fix error from `visualize` when passed `generate()`d `infer_dist` objects that had not been passed to `hypothesize()` (#432). 
* Update visual checks for `visualize` output to align with the R 4.1.0+ graphics engine (#438).
* `specify()` and wrapper functions now appropriately handle ordered factors (#439).
* Clarify error when incompatible statistics and hypotheses are supplied (#441).

warning will be raised less often when `type = "bootstrap"` (#425).
* Allow passing additional arguments to `stats::chisq.test` via `...` in 
`calculate()`. Ellipses are now always passed to the applicable base R
hypothesis testing function, when applicable (#414)!
* The package will now set the levels of logical variables on conversion to factor
so that the first level (regarded as `success` by default) is `TRUE`. Core verbs
have warned without an explicit `success` value already, and this change makes
behavior consistent with the functions being wrapped by shorthand test 
wrappers (#440).
* Added new statistic `stat = "ratio of means"` (#452).

# infer 1.0.0

v1.0.0 is the first major release of the {infer} package! By and large, the core verbs `specify()`, `hypothesize()`, `generate()`, and `calculate()` will interface as they did before. This release makes several improvements to behavioral consistency of the package and introduces support for theory-based inference as well as randomization-based inference with multiple explanatory variables.

## Behavioral consistency

A major change to the package in this release is a set of standards for behavorial consistency of `calculate()` (#356). Namely, the package will now

* supply a consistent error when the supplied `stat` argument isn't well-defined
for the variables `specify()`d

``` r
gss %>%
  specify(response = hours) %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means")
#> Error: A difference in means is not well-defined for a 
#> numeric response variable (hours) and no explanatory variable.
```

or

``` r
gss %>%
  specify(college ~ partyid, success = "degree") %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in props")
#> Error: A difference in proportions is not well-defined for a dichotomous categorical 
#> response variable (college) and a multinomial categorical explanatory variable (partyid).
```

* supply a consistent message when the user supplies unneeded information via `hypothesize()` to `calculate()` an observed statistic

``` r
# supply mu = 40 when it's not needed
gss %>%
  specify(response = hours) %>%
  hypothesize(null = "point", mu = 40) %>%
  calculate(stat = "mean")
#> Message: The point null hypothesis `mu = 40` does not inform calculation of 
#> the observed statistic (a mean) and will be ignored.
#> # A tibble: 1 x 1
#>    stat
#>   <dbl>
#> 1  41.4
```

and

* supply a consistent warning and assume a reasonable null value when the user does not supply sufficient information to calculate an observed statistic

``` r
# don't hypothesize `p` when it's needed
gss %>%
    specify(response = sex, success = "female") %>%
    calculate(stat = "z")
#> # A tibble: 1 x 1
#>    stat
#>   <dbl>
#> 1 -1.16
#> Warning message:
#> A z statistic requires a null hypothesis to calculate the observed statistic. 
#> Output assumes the following null value: `p = .5`. 
```

or

``` r
# don't hypothesize `p` when it's needed
gss %>%
  specify(response = partyid) %>%
  calculate(stat = "Chisq")
#> # A tibble: 1 x 1
#>    stat
#>  <dbl>
#> 1  334.
#> Warning message:
#> A chi-square statistic requires a null hypothesis to calculate the observed statistic. 
#> Output assumes the following null values: `p = c(dem = 0.2, ind = 0.2, rep = 0.2, other = 0.2, DK = 0.2)`.
```

To accommodate this behavior, a number of new `calculate` methods were added or improved. Namely:

- Implemented the standardized proportion $z$ statistic for one categorical variable
- Extended `calculate()` with `stat = "t"` by passing `mu` to the `calculate()` method for `stat = "t"` to allow for calculation of `t` statistics for one numeric variable with hypothesized mean
- Extended `calculate()` to allow lowercase aliases for `stat` arguments (#373).
- Fixed bugs in `calculate()` for to allow for programmatic calculation of statistics

This behavorial consistency also allowed for the implementation of `observe()`, a wrapper function around `specify()`, `hypothesize()`, and `calculate()`, to calculate observed statistics. The function provides a shorthand alternative to calculating observed statistics from data:

``` r
# calculating the observed mean number of hours worked per week
gss %>%
  observe(hours ~ NULL, stat = "mean")
#> # A tibble: 1 x 1
#>    stat
#>   <dbl>
#> 1  41.4

# equivalently, calculating the same statistic with the core verbs
gss %>%
  specify(response = hours) %>%
  calculate(stat = "mean")
#> # A tibble: 1 x 1
#>    stat
#>   <dbl>
#> 1  41.4

# calculating a t statistic for hypothesized mu = 40 hours worked/week
gss %>%
  observe(hours ~ NULL, stat = "t", null = "point", mu = 40)
#> # A tibble: 1 x 1
#>    stat
#>   <dbl>
#> 1  2.09

# equivalently, calculating the same statistic with the core verbs
gss %>%
  specify(response = hours) %>%
  hypothesize(null = "point", mu = 40) %>%
  calculate(stat = "t")
#> # A tibble: 1 x 1
#>    stat
#>   <dbl>
#> 1  2.09
```

We don't anticipate that these changes are "breaking" in the sense that code that previously worked will continue to, though it may now message or warn in a way that it did not used to or error with a different (and hopefully more informative) message.

## A framework for theoretical inference

This release also introduces a more complete and principled interface for theoretical inference. While the package previously supplied some methods for visualization of theory-based curves, the interface did not provide any object that was explicitly a "null distribution" that could be supplied to helper functions like `get_p_value()` and `get_confidence_interval()`. The new interface is based on a new verb, `assume()`, that returns a null distribution that can be interfaced in the same way that simulation-based null distributions can be interfaced with.

As an example, we'll work through a full infer pipeline for inference on a mean using infer's `gss` dataset. Supposed that we believe the true mean number of hours worked by Americans in the past week is 40.

First, calculating the observed `t`-statistic:

``` r
obs_stat <- gss %>%
  specify(response = hours) %>%
  hypothesize(null = "point", mu = 40) %>%
  calculate(stat = "t")

obs_stat
#> Response: hours (numeric)
#> Null Hypothesis: point
#> # A tibble: 1 x 1
#>    stat
#>   <dbl>
#> 1  2.09
```

The code to define the null distribution is very similar to that required to calculate a theorized observed statistic, switching out `calculate()` for `assume()` and replacing arguments as needed.

``` r
null_dist <- gss %>%
  specify(response = hours) %>%
  assume(distribution = "t")

null_dist 
#> A T distribution with 499 degrees of freedom.
```

This null distribution can now be interfaced with in the same way as a simulation-based null distribution elsewhere in the package. For example, calculating a p-value by juxtaposing the observed statistic and null distribution:

``` r
get_p_value(null_dist, obs_stat, direction = "both")
#> # A tibble: 1 x 1
#>   p_value
#>     <dbl>
#> 1  0.0376
```

…or visualizing the null distribution alone:

``` r
visualize(null_dist)
```

![](https://i.imgur.com/g3B5coD.png)

…or juxtaposing the two visually:

``` r
visualize(null_dist) + 
  shade_p_value(obs_stat, direction = "both")
```

![](https://i.imgur.com/3C66kgK.png)

Confidence intervals lie in data space rather than the standardized scale of the theoretical distributions. Calculating a mean rather than the standardized `t`-statistic:

``` r
obs_mean <- gss %>%
  specify(response = hours) %>%
  calculate(stat = "mean")
```

The null distribution here just defines the spread for the standard error calculation.

``` r
ci <- 
  get_confidence_interval(
    null_dist,
    level = .95,
    point_estimate = obs_mean
  )

ci
#> # A tibble: 1 x 2
#>   lower_ci upper_ci
#>      <dbl>    <dbl>
#> 1     40.1     42.7
```

Visualizing the confidence interval results in the theoretical distribution being recentered and rescaled to align with the scale of the observed data:

``` r
visualize(null_dist) + 
  shade_confidence_interval(ci)
```

![](https://i.imgur.com/4akSCY3.png)

Previous methods for interfacing with theoretical distributions are superseded—they will continue to be supported, though documentation will forefront the `assume()` interface.

## Support for multiple regression

The 2016 "Guidelines for Assessment and Instruction in Statistics Education" [1] state that, in introductory statistics courses, "[s]tudents should gain experience with how statistical models, including multivariable models, are used." In line with this recommendation, we introduce support for randomization-based inference with multiple explanatory variables via a new `fit.infer` core verb.

If passed an `infer` object, the method will parse a formula out of the `formula` or `response` and `explanatory` arguments, and pass both it and `data` to a `stats::glm` call.

``` r
gss %>%
  specify(hours ~ age + college) %>%
  fit()
#> # A tibble: 3 x 2
#>   term          estimate
#>   <chr>            <dbl>
#> 1 intercept     40.6    
#> 2 age            0.00596
#> 3 collegedegree  1.53
```

Note that the function returns the model coefficients as `estimate` rather than their associated `t`-statistics as `stat`.

If passed a `generate()`d object, the model will be fitted to each replicate.

``` r
gss %>%
  specify(hours ~ age + college) %>%
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  generate(reps = 100, type = "permute") %>%
  fit()
#> # A tibble: 300 x 3
#> # Groups:   replicate [100]
#>    replicate term          estimate
#>        <int> <chr>            <dbl>
#>  1         1 intercept     44.4    
#>  2         1 age           -0.0767 
#>  3         1 collegedegree  0.121  
#>  4         2 intercept     41.8    
#>  5         2 age            0.00344
#>  6         2 collegedegree -1.59   
#>  7         3 intercept     38.3    
#>  8         3 age            0.0761 
#>  9         3 collegedegree  0.136  
#> 10         4 intercept     43.1    
#> # … with 290 more rows
```

If `type = "permute"`, a set of unquoted column names in the data to permute (independently of each other) can be passed via the `variables` argument to `generate`. It defaults to only the response variable.

``` r
gss %>%
  specify(hours ~ age + college) %>%
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  generate(reps = 100, type = "permute", variables = c(age, college)) %>%
  fit()
#> # A tibble: 300 x 3
#> # Groups:   replicate [100]
#>    replicate term          estimate
#>        <int> <chr>            <dbl>
#>  1         1 intercept      39.4   
#>  2         1 age             0.0748
#>  3         1 collegedegree  -2.98  
#>  4         2 intercept      42.8   
#>  5         2 age            -0.0190
#>  6         2 collegedegree  -1.83  
#>  7         3 intercept      40.4   
#>  8         3 age             0.0354
#>  9         3 collegedegree  -1.31  
#> 10         4 intercept      40.9   
#> # … with 290 more rows
```

This feature allows for more detailed exploration of the effect of disrupting the correlation structure among explanatory variables on outputted model coefficients.

Each of the auxillary functions `get_p_value()`, `get_confidence_interval()`, `visualize()`, `shade_p_value()`, and `shade_confidence_interval()` have methods to handle `fit()` output! See their help-files for example usage. Note that `shade_*` functions now delay evaluation until they are added to an existing ggplot (e.g. that outputted by `visualize()`) with `+`.

## Improvements

- Following extensive discussion, the `generate()` type `type = "simulate"` has been renamed to the more evocative `type = "draw"`. We will continue to support `type = "simulate"` indefinitely, though supplying that argument will now prompt a message notifying the user of its preferred alias. (#233, #390)
- Fixed several bugs related to factors with unused levels. `specify()` will now drop unused factor levels and message that it has done so. (#374, #375, #397, #380)
- Added `two.sided` as an acceptable alias for `two_sided` for the `direction` argument in `get_p_value()` and `shade_p_value()`. (#355)
- Various improvements to documentation, including extending example sections in help-files, re-organizing the function reference in the {pkgdown} site, and linking more extensively among help-files.

## Breaking changes

We don't anticipate that any changes made in this release are "breaking" in the sense that code that previously worked will continue to, though it may now message or warn in a way that it did not used to or error with a different (and hopefully more informative) message. If you currently teach or research with infer, we recommend re-running your materials and noting any changes in messaging and warning.

- Move forward with a number of planned deprecations. Namely, the `GENERATION_TYPES` object is now fully deprecated, and arguments that were relocated from `visualize()` to `shade_p_value()` and `shade_confidence_interval()` are now fully deprecated in `visualize()`. If supplied a deprecated argument, `visualize()` will warn the user and ignore the argument.
- Added a `prop` argument to `rep_slice_sample()` as an alternative to the `n`
argument for specifying the proportion of rows in the supplied data to sample
per replicate (#361, #362, #363). This changes order of arguments of
`rep_slice_sample()` (in order to be more aligned with `dplyr::slice_sample()`)
which might break code if it didn't use named arguments (like
`rep_slice_sample(df, 5, TRUE)`). To fix this, use named arguments (like
`rep_slice_sample(df, 5, replicate = TRUE)`).

## Other

- Added Simon P. Couch as an author. Long deserved for his reliable maintenance and improvements of the package.
