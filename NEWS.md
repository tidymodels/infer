# infer 0.5.4.9000

To be released as 0.6.0.

## Breaking changes

- Added a `prop` argument to `rep_slice_sample()` as an alternative to the `n`
argument for specifying the proportion of rows in the supplied data to sample
per replicate (#361, #362, #363). This changes order of arguments of
`rep_slice_sample()` (in order to be more aligned with `dplyr::slice_sample()`)
which might break code if it didn't use named arguments (like
`rep_slice_sample(df, 5, TRUE)`). To fix this, use named arguments (like
`rep_slice_sample(df, 5, replicate = TRUE)`).

## Improvements

- Improved behavioral consistency of `calculate()`. The package will now
   * supply a consistent error when the supplied `stat` argument isn't well-defined
for the variables specified
   * supply a message when the user supplies unneeded information to calculate
an observed statistic, and
   * supply a warning and assume a reasonable null value when the user does 
not supply sufficient information to calculate an observed statistic
- Added `observe()`, a wrapper function around `specify()`, `hypothesize()`, and 
`calculate()`, to calculate observed statistics.
- Implemented the standardized proportion $z$ statistic for one categorical variable
- Added `two.sided` as an acceptable alias for `two_sided` for the 
`direction` argument in `get_p_value()` and `shade_p_value()` (#355)
- Various bug fixes and improvements to internal consistency

## Other

- Added Simon P. Couch as an author. Long deserved for his reliable maintenance and improvements of the package.

# infer 0.5.4

- `rep_sample_n()` no longer errors when supplied a `prob` argument (#279)
- Added `rep_slice_sample()`, a light wrapper around `rep_sample_n()`, that
more closely resembles `dplyr::slice_sample()` (the function that supersedes
`dplyr::sample_n()`) (#325)
- Added a `success`, `correct`, and `z` argument to `prop_test()` 
(#343, #347, #353)
- Implemented observed statistic calculation for the standardized proportion 
$z$ statistic (#351, #353)
- Various bug fixes and improvements to documentation and errors.

# infer 0.5.3

## Breaking changes

- `get_confidence_interval()` now uses column names ('lower_ci' and 'upper_ci') 
in output that are consistent with other infer functionality (#317).

## New functionality

- `get_confidence_interval()` can now produce bias-corrected confidence intervals
by setting `type = "bias-corrected"`. Thanks to @davidbaniadam for the 
initial implementation (#237, #318)!

- `shade_p_value()` now uses "area under the curve" approach to shading (#229).

# infer 0.4.0

## Breaking changes

- Changed method of computing two-sided p-value to a more conventional one. It also makes `get_pvalue()` and `visualize()` more aligned (#205).

- Deprecated `conf_int()` (use `get_confidence_interval()` instead) (#180).
- Deprecated (via warnings) plotting p-value and confidence interval in `visualize()` (use new functions `shade_p_value()` and `shade_confidence_interval()` instead) (#178).

## New functions

- `shade_p_value()` - {ggplot2}-like layer function to add information about p-value region to `visualize()` output. Has alias `shade_pvalue()`.
- `shade_confidence_interval()` - {ggplot2}-like layer function to add information about confidence interval region to `visualize()` output. Has alias `shade_ci()`.

# infer 0.3.0

    - `direction = "between"` to get the green shading
    - Currently working only for simulation-based methods

on `specify()` and `hypothesize()`
    - Added message if `type` is given differently than expected
